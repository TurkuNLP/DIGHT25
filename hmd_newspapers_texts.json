  "HEALTH OF THE TROOPS.\n\nThe troops continue remarkably healthy. Their duties are\ncomparatively light. Excepting the guards for the divisional\nstaff establishments, the usual regimental guards, and those in\nthe part of Sebastopol occupied by the British, they are chiefly\nemployed on fatigue duties ; such as making the military roads,\ncollecting stones from the batteries, building walls and enclo-\nsures for the commissariat stores, or stabling for the animals\nbelonging to the Land Transport Corps, draining the camps,\nrepairing the water tanks, collecting gabions from the trenches\nor enemy's works\u2014these being the only wood issued at present\nfor fuel\u2014or other employments of a like nature. There are,\nconsequently, few night duties, and this is, doubtless, one cir-\ncumstance which is greatly conducive to the present sanitary\ncondition of the men. The younger. soldiers are being in-\nstructed in drill, and many of the regimental parade grounds\npresent the appearance rather of what might be expected to\nbe seen at an encampment in England, than under the walls\nof Sebastopol. The Highland Division are making prepara-\ntions for changing their ground near Samara. The brigade\nwill move about a mile further in the direction of Baidar, and\nthe other regiments will take up positions, though not so far\nfrom the site of their present encampments, towards the same\npoint. In consequence of the departure of the Ottoman troops\nfor Asia, the greater part of the outpost duties, which were\nformerly performed by them, will now devolve upon the men\nof the Highland Division.\nIMPORTANT CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF\n",

  "NEW BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY.\n\nAx anonymous writer in the New World has some-\nwhat skilfully grouped together many of the wonderful\nexchanges which advancing civilisation has effected,\nand the spirit of enterprise brought to their shores.\nThe . picture is almost equally true and graphic when\napplied to either hemisphere.' To take a condensed\nview of the opening of new branches of industry\nAmong the two or three hundred thousand vegetables\nand animals that God has created to satisfy our natural\nand artificial wants, there are very few that we have\nyet acclimated or domesticated, or know how to em-\nploy. However few they may be, we continue to\nincrease them, and our power to make acquisitions\nwould appear to have no limits but those of creation.\nA considerable number of the plants which grow\namong us have been brought very recently from cli-\nmates quite different from ours. It will be useful to\nnotice this fact. Thus, Asia has given us hemp, the\ncherry, the peach, the French bean, the tarragon, the\nonion, rhubarb, mint, the mulberry, the citron, the\nlime, the orange, the chesnut, the pine of Siberia, the\npine of Jerusalem, the plane-tree of the East, the aloe,\nthe rose of Provence, the mallow rose, the millet, the\ncypress, and so forth. Grain and buck-wheat we get\nfrom the Levant, and the olive from Africa. Europe\nhas borrowed from America the potato, the maize,\ntobacco, the banana, the love-apple, the strawberry,\nthe medlar-tree, and a hundred other trees, fruits,\nplants, and flowers. Within three or four centuries\nEurope and America have been literally invaded with\nvegetables from all parts of the globe. We live almost\nentirely upon what has been borrowed from other\ncountries, and it is but the advance-guard of the im-\nmense quantity and variety which science, and the\nrapid intercommunication between the different parts\nof the world will give us. We are at liberty to choose\nfrom the general herbal of creation all that suits us.\nAn inventory of all the riches we appropriate would\nbe a long one. It would be almost endless labour to\ngive such a catalogue of creation. To glance at a few\nonly of the alimentary plants,\u2014the arto carpe (so\nprecious to the inhabitants of Tahiti), the sagotier, the\npalm cabbage, the bamboo of Celebes (of which the\n",

  "THE TREATY WITH SWEDEN.\n\nIlium speculation has been going on with reference\nto the real object of the recent mission of General\nCANROBERT to the court of Sweden, it having been\ngenerally thought that the main design was to induce\nthe Scandinavian Powers of Sweden and Denmark to\njoin the Western Alliance in active hostility to Russia.\nIt now appears from the official publication in the\nMoniteur, that a treaty has been concluded, though\nsomewhat modified in its conditions to what was at\none time hoped for, yet still in a degree favourable\nto the Allies. It could hardly be expected that\nSweden would, unless under the pressure of necessity,\nembroil herself with a powerful neighbour in such\ndangerous proximity to her shores by any active\nmeasures of hostility except such as would be justified\nby defence. She has, however, consented to hold her\newn ports and naval resources against any attempts of\nRussia to avail herself of them, in return for which\nFrance and England agree to afford her assistance in\nthe event of her being assailed by Russia, The effect\nof this arrangement will be that the Northern despot\nwill not be permitted to compensate for his naval de-\nficiencies by taking advantage of the resources of\nSweden, whichiin the event of a farther .complication\nof the state ef affairs may be induced\u2022to lend more\nefficient aid. It will be necessary, however, that our\nown Baltic fleet should prove of more -active service\nthan it 'has done during the last two:seasons. We\nwant an Admiral who shall have better, claims to credit\nthan biinging home his ships in safety-, leaving the\nRassianikeet in the same happy state. 'The next year\nmust he commenced under 'fitr differentauspices, with\nno grOunds for complaint that the q\u2022equisite supplies\nwere -wanting to comrade 'the deStraction began at\nSweihorg, and should Russia net 'anticipate defeat by\ntintely concessions, we 'Shill expect:a better account of\nthe Russian fleet sheltered at Cronetadt.\n",

  "DISCOVERY OF SAXON COINS.\n\nTHE discovery of coins and bars of silver at Scotby\nis a very interesting circumstance. They were proba-\nbly the property of the \" moneyer,\" or mint-master of\nthis district, for there is no question that a mint\nexisted here shortly after the Conquest, and the pro-\nbability is that it had existence before. In the 31st\nyear of the reign of Henry 1., the burgesses of Carlisle\nrendered account of one hundred shillings for the\n\" Old Farm of the Silver Mine ;\" and in the same year\nWilliam and Hildred accounted for \u00a340., \" For the\nFarm of the Silver Mine for the year past.\" Again,\nin the 4th year of the reign of Henry IL, William\nthe son of Erembald, accounted for one hundred marks\nof silver for the\"\" Farm of the Mine ;\" and in the first\nyear of Richard 1., under the heading of \" The Mine\nof Carlisle,\" Adan, the nephew of Rodin, accounted\nfor \u00a3249 16s. 11d., for the \" Old Farm ;\" \" Alan the\nMoneyer,\" for \u00a3lOO of the farm of that year ; and\nWilliam, son of Erembald, for \u00a32,155 6s. Bd., of the\n\" Mine of Carlisle,\" for years past in which he held it.\nThese items clearly show that there were silver mines\nin the neighbourhood of oldstanding, and. a \"moneyer,\"\nor mint-master. Yet, although the freshness of the\ncoins now found, and the bars accompanying them,\nwould seem to indicate that they must have been\ncoins remaining in the hands of the moneyer, and not\nin circulation, there is nothing to show that any of\nthem were actually coined at Carlisle\u2014at least so far\nas the superscriptions have been published. On the\ncontrary, one bears on it decisiVe evidence of its coin-\nage at another place. A contemporary has published\nthe superscriptions of six of them, among which one\nruns as follows :\u2014Obverse\u2014\" }Ethelstan Rex Brle.\"\nReverse\u2014\" Abba Mon. Legec. F.\" The latter is\nerroneously read by him, \" Abba moneta Legec fait,\"\n\u2014\"The money of a place called Abba, coinedby Legec.\"\nIt is clearly Abba Monetarius Legecestrencis fecit ; in\nEnglish, \"Abba the Moneyer of Chester made this.\"\nIt was, therefore coined at Chester ; and in all proba-\nbility immediately after, perhaps on occasion of, the\nsuccesses of Athelstan over the Welsh and other petty\npowers, which gave him the sovereignty of the whole\nkingdom. The superscription on the obverse, if rightly\ngiven, may perhaps be explained on this supposition :\n\u2014The word Brle may be an abbreviation of the words\n\"Britannw Longe ;\" and if so, the superscription would\nread, \" Athelstan, King of all Britain.\" It is well\nknown that he so styled himself after subduing the\n",

  "THE HARVEST.\n\nSo much of national prosperity depends upon the\nabundance of the harvest, that it is gratifying to notice\nthe really beautiful weather with which Providence\nhas lately blessed the nation. It has come at what\nmay be called the latter end of the harvest ; but it\nmust be remembered that this is of the greater im-\nportance, inasmuch as it is the late districts which\nordinarily suffer most from unfavograble weather. It\nhas enabled the farmers to get in their corn in the\nbest possible condition, and at the same time to banish\nthose apprehensions which were at one time enter-\ntained of the re-appearance of disease in the potato\ncrop. The latter esculent enters largely into the food\nof the population, and whatever may be the statements\nmade by those whose interests are to keep up prices,\nthe public may judge for themselves of their falsity\nby the quality of the potatoes which they consume.\nThese are notoriously what is called mealy, and it is a\nwell-known fact that the tendency of the disease is to\ninjure or destroy this quality ; so that it may confi-\ndently be assumed that this crop has not been in better\ncondition since the first appearance of this mysterious\ndisorder about nine years ago. The effect Vial neces-\nsarily be to diminish the consumption of wheat ; and as\nthe latter article has been kept at a high price, owing\nto the demands for the continent, where the harvest,\nthough late, is new being gathered in good condition,\nwe may reasonably anticipate that recent high prices,\nwhich have already begun to give way, will very shortly\nbe considerably reduced.\nThe reports from America concur in representations\nof a most abundant yield of the wheat harvest, and the\nprice of flour in the New York market has very ra-\npidly fallen. The downfal of the Russian power in the\nBlack Sea will open the resources of the Danube for\nlarge supplies from that quarter ; se.that, with our own\nharvest, which is now acknowledged by competent\nauthorities to be above an average, in addition to the\nmuch greater breadth of land in wheat, there ought\nto be no Tears as to a sufficiency ef food for the popu-\nlation. The fine weather will have added materially\nto the resources of the country, enabling us so much\nthe better to bear the heavy burdens rendered neces=\nsary by the war ; and even the pressure on the money\nmarket will not be without a good effect, because it\nwill impose a wholesome restriction on the operations\nof mere speculators, who look for their gains from 1\nnational distress.\n",

The house went into\ncommittee on the Nuisances Removal Bill, and clauses from 1\nto 16, after several verbal amendments, were agreed to.\nCOAL MINES AT HERACLIA.\u2014In reply to Mr. EWART, Mr.\nWILSON said, the quantity of coal produced at Heraclia and\nother places on the south coast of the Euxine had increased to\n60,000 tons per annum, sufficient for the supply of the French\nand English navies in that sea ; that the royalty payable to\nthe Turkish government was 10s. per ton, and the cost of the\ncoal was 15s. per ton, making the total cost on board 255. ; but\nit was expected that it would be reduced to about 20s. per\nton ; and that the quality of the coal was very good.\nTHE POLICE.\u2014The conduct of the police towards the public\nin Hyde-park and elsewhere was made the subject of a pro-\nlonged and irregular discussion.\u2014Mr. ROBBITCK alluded to a\nspecial case of alleged brutality, perpetrated by a constable on\na man sitting peaceably in a news-room, upon which Sir G.\nGrey promised that investigation should take place.\u2014The\nHOME SECRETARY afterwards said, in answer to Mr. J. G.\nPhillimore, that no special or general inquiry would be insti-\ntuted concerning the conduct of the police in Hyde-park.\nThe house went again into committee upon the Tenants' Im-\nprovements Compensation (Ireland) Bill, and the entire evening\nwas expended upon the 14th clause\u2014an important one\u2014the\ndebate being diversified by the discussion of a question respect-\ning three disputed votes, which was referred to the Speaker.\nUltimately, the clause was negatived by 138 to 102.\u2014Mr.\nSergeant S]IEE appealed to Lord Palmerston whether, after\nthis decision, he would go on with the bill.\u2014Lord PALMERS.\nTON reproached Mr. Shee somewhat severely for the course he\nhad taken with reference to this measure.\u2014Mr. Sergeant\nSHER retorted with much bitterness, and, after a smart re-\njoinder from Lord PALMERSTON, the Chairman reported pro-\ngress.\u2014The question concerning the disputed votes, which\ninvolved points of some nicety, was then considered and\nadjudicated upon by the SpEAKEit.\nThe Merchant Shipping Act Amendment Bill went through\ncommittee.\nThe amendments to the Endowed Schools ( Ireland) Bill\nwere considered and agreed to.\n",

  "EMBARKATION OF CAVALRY.\n\nThe cavalry is beginning to leave. The King's Dragoon\nGuards were embarked yesterday and the day befoie; and the\nBth Hussars are embarking to-day. Both of these regiments\nhad huts for their men, and shelter for at least part of their\nhorses, whereas the 10th Hussars are without either, exposed\non a bleak hill, with a number of horses still sick, and a still\ngreater number scarcely recovered, and have a fair chance of\nlosing half their valuable horses, should the cold set in before\nthey are embarked. They have, indeed, received orders to go\ndown to the valley, and take up in the meantime the camp\nhitherto occupied by the Bth, but, having double the number\nof horses and these mostly entire horses, which have to be\npicketed far apart, it will be rather a difficult problem to place\nall their horses without putting some on the road which runs\nat the foot of their new encampment, or without perching\nothers on the steep rocks which rise up on the other side.\nBesides this, they will have double their work, striking their\ncamp and transferring it, and then breaking it up again when\ntheir turn for embarking comes. And all this because their\nnumber happens to be 10, and 10 comes after 8!\n\nINTENDED BOMBARDMENT OF THE\nNORTH-SIDE FORTS.\n\n-\nThe Paris correspondent of the Globe, writi,,,gos on Wednes\nh\nitli:e erill\ninten-\ntion day morning says, \"It is stated in quarters v\ninforma-\ntion has often proved correct, that, although the winter\nput a stop to field operations in the Crimea, it is t\nof the allied generals to subject the northern part of\nSebastopol to a bombardment of mortars, which will probably\nhave the effect of dislodging the enemy from Forts sievernaia,\nConstantine, and their vicinity. It is stated that the floating\nbatteries, whose efficiency and invulnerability were so effec-\ntually tested at Kinburn, will take a prominent part in the\nattack, while twenty-six batteries, armed with mortars of the\nheaviest calibre, will deluge the Russian forts from the\nsouthern shore. Eighteen of these batteries will be manned\nby French and Sardinian troops, and eight by the English\narmy. Although I am not able to guarantee positively the\ncorrectness of this information, it is so very circumstantial,\nthat it is difficult to suppose there is no foundation for it.\"\n",

The traders seat message on shore under a flag of\ntruce, asking the meaning. of the stoppage of trade. They\nwere told in reply that the chiefs who had taken refuge with\nthe traders were accused of\" poisoning the late King Dappo,\nand until those men were given; up, trade would not be re-\nstored. A meeting was held, and it was determined to send\ndown to Fernando Po and bring the chiefs back, as, from the\nstate of the people, and the preparations they were making, it\nwas impossible to say what result would follow. In the mean-\ntime the ships were moored beyond gun-shot range.

  "BROMLEY'S PATENT EMPIRE SOAP,\nwhich heretofore has been difficult to be obtained, as very\nfew of the grocers will keep it. To use their own words, by way .\nof explanation, they state,\u2014\" Were we to buy it, would reduce\nour sales fully one third, as two pounds of the Empire Soap will\ngo as far as three pounds of any other soap ; we should also lose\nour profit on soda and washing powders, as neither of these\narticles are required when the Empire Soap is used, in either the\nhardest water or in sea water.\" What the grocers are displeased\nat in this soap is its strongest recommendation to the notice of\nthe large consumers, private families, hotel keepers, laundresses,\n&C. It only requires to be used with a light hand. And besides\nthe above advantage it saves half the usual labour, consequently\nless friction and wear in the clothes, and will not injure the\ncolours in the most delicate prints ; and is equally valuable for\nevery other domestic purpose, even for toilet use, as it is a pure\nsoap, free from rosin and other useless ingredients, which not\nonly add unnecessary weight to the soap but detract from its\ncleansing properties.\nTo be had wholesale at the Works, No. 22, Cherry-lane, and\nfrom the following dealers :\u2014Mr. Edward Davies, chandler, No.\n84, London-road ; Messrs.

  "expressly for the purchase of pictures ; and that it will not be\nnecessary to expend the grant in each particular year, but\nthat it may be formed into a cumulative fund, out of which\nconsiderable collections may occasionally be purchased, as\nopportunity offers. This condition, however, is one which\nwill require to be narrowly watched. Misplaced partiality,\nwhim, or individual influence, may be so readily brought to\nbear mile, expenditure of such a fund, that zealous watch-\nfulness alone can secure its satisfactory outlay. By one\nportion of the new arrangements Sir CHARLES EASTLAKE has\nbeen appointed director, with authority, independent of and\nparamount to that of the trustees, as to the purchase of any\npicture or collection. The director, in terms of his appoint-\nment, is required to lay an annual report before Parliament,\nso that the affairs and condition of the National Gallery will\nbe brought yearly under supervision of the House of Cora-\nmons. A new museum of science and art is to be built near\nthe, site of the old Crystal Palace, at the national cost, aided\nby the surplus fund derived from the Great Exhibition of\n1851. When completed, the museum will be open to the\npublic gratuitously.\nThe poetical department of the literary world has been\nagitated, convulsed, distracted, within the last few days, for\nthe fortieth or fiftieth time within a year or two. The POET\nLAUREATE has issued \"a great poem,\" is the breathless ex.\nclamation of one set of enthusiasts ; TENNYSON has pub-\nlished his \" Maud, and other poems,\" is the quiet remark of\nanother. It is glorious, rich, glowing, extatic, says one ; it is\nbeautiful, chaste, and stately, says another. Within the last\nfew years so many thefts and spurious snatches have been\nmade of APOLLO'S fire, that the announcement of a new\nclaimant for poetic fame is met with an ominous shake of the\nbead by the sagacious\u2014the doubt implied being magnified\nin its portent in proportion to the brazen sounds which have\nbeen made to herald the candidate's approach. What between\nBIGGS, SMITHS, and BAILEYS, and their noisy trumpeters,\nthe poetic circle has been kept in a perfect uproar for years\npast, and a modest minstrel who should rely upon his merits\nis rudely hustled out of the arena. In the midst of the' chaos\nso created, it is refreshing, as well as inspiriting, to meet with\na song in which nature is allowed to wfrlk on the earth, wan-\ndering among meadows, and flowers, and woods, and associated\nwith well-conditioned human beings, instead of being whisked\naway into the region of broken suns, stray planets, and lunatic'\nstars, holding converse with misanthropic angels and saints of\nmore than doubtful purity. TENNYSON'S song is full of\nhealthy feeling, and is in fine contrast to the spasmodic verse\nso admirably and felicitously ridiculed in Firmilian.\n",

Get a good\nbreadth of cabbage planted thickly in rich ground to\nfurnish winter greens.\u2014Gardener's Chronicle.\nIMPROVING FRUIT, &c.\u2014A correspondent of the\nGardeners' Chronicle says,\" I have, from observation\nand a series of trials, ascertained that all sorts of fruits\ncan be raised about one third larger than they usually\nare, and their qualities much improved, simply by sup-\nporting the fruit in the following manner :\u2014As soon\nas it is fully developed, it should not be allowed to\nhang its weight upon its stalk, as the increasing weight\nstrains the stalk, and in that way lessens the quantity\nof nutritious fluid flowing to the fruit. This may be\nobviated in some cases by laying the pear, apple, or\nwhatever it may be, upon a branch, and fixing it with\na piece of matting, to prevent its being moved by the\nwind ; or by putting it into a small net, made for the\npurpose, at the same time keeping the stalk in a hori-\nzontal position, when it can be done without twisting\nor bending it\u2014as the bending, either accidentally or by\nthe weight of the fruit, is in my opinion most injurious\nto its growth ; for the pores of the woody stalk are\nstrained on one side of the bend, and compressed on\nthe other ; hence the vessels through which the re-\nquisite nourishment flows being thus partially shut up,\nthe growth of the fruit is retarded in proportion to the\nstraining and compressing of the stalk, The fixing of\nthe fruit also prevents the risk of its fallinc, off and get-\nting damaged before it reaches maturity. I have\ngrown dahlias upon the same principle, and with similar\nsuccess, and I have no doubt that the most of flower-\nblooms, especially those which are weighty and inclin-\ning, can be grown much larger by the system referred\nto, and, in short, all sorts of vegetables, trees, &c.\"\n",

  "FIRMNESS AND lIONESTY OF NEWTON\n\nThe last thing, Sir, that I shall trouble you with, shall be\na passage relating to the coinage of the copper money some\nyears ago, which pleased me much in setting forth the\n\nintegrity of my friend Sir Isaac. The occasion of our dis-\ncourse was, the great inconveniences which many underwent\nby the delay of the coinage of this sort of money. The occa-\nsion of which delay Sir Isaac told me, was from the numerous-\npetitions that were presented to them, in most of which some\nperson or other of quality was concerned. Amongst others,\nhe told me that an agent of one had made him an offer of\nabove \u00a36,000, which Sir Isaac refusing on account of its being\na bribe, the agent said he saw no dishonesty in the acceptance\nof the offer, and that Sir Isaac understood not his own interest.\nTo which Sir Isaac replied, that he knew well enough what\nwas his duty, and that no bribes should corrupt him. The\nagent then told him, that he came from a great Dutchesse,\nand pleaded her quality and interest. To which Sir Isaac\nroughly answered, \" I desire you to tell the lady, that if she\nwas here herself, and had made me this offer, I would have\ndesired her to *go out of my house; and so I desire you, or you\nshall be turned out.\" Afterwards he learned who the\nDutchesse was.\"\n\nNewton's great attainments as a chemist have been\nalready alluded to, and the fitness for the office of\nMaster of the Mint, which those attainments conferred\non him, have been glanced at. That these qualifica-\ntions were chiefly obtained by diligent study of the\nfruitless science of alchemy, is no diminution of their\npractical value, nor couldit at all justify the unprincipled\nattempt to denude him of the office and saddle the\ncountry with the heavy annual burden of \u00a32,000\nduring his life, as a pension to him for giving up the\nplace that a political partizan of the Minister might\nbe inducted to it.

We couldn a plant the\npotawtoes. But the lift was clear. Between\neight and nine, a snaw-storm came doun frae the\nmountains about Loch Skene, noo a whirl, and\nnoo a blash, till the grun' was whitey-blue, wi' a\nsliddery sort o' sleet, and the Yarrow began to roar\nwi' the melted broo, alang its frost-bound borders,\nand aneath its banks, a' hanging wi' icicles,\nnane o' them thinner than my twa arms. Wed,\nthen, about eleven it began to rain, for the wand\nhad shifted\u2014and afore denner-time, it was an\nevendoun pour. It fell town about sax\u2014and the\nair grew close and sultry to a degree that was\nfearsome. Wha wud hae expeckit a thunder-\nstorm on the eve o' sic a day ? But the heavens,\nin the thundery airt, were like a dungeon\u2014and I\nsaw the lightning playing like meteors athwart\nthe blackness, lang before ony growl was in the\ngloom. Then, a' at ante, like a waukened lion,\nthe thunder rose up in his den, and shaking his\nmane o' brindled clouds, broke out into sic a roar\nthat the very sun shuddered in eclipse\u2014and the\ngrews and collies that happened to be sittin\nbeside me on a bit knowe, gaed whinin into the\nhouse wi' their tails atween their legs, just yen-\nturin a haflin glance to the howling heavens noo\na' in a low, for the fire was strong and fierce in\nelectrical matter, and at intervals the illuminated\nmountains seemed to vomit out conflagration like\nverra volcanoes.\n\nSHEPHERD : Afore sunset, heaven and earth,\n",

  "CATTLE.\n\nLIVERPOOL, SEPT. 10.\u2014We have had increased supplies of\ncattle at this day's market, with only a moderate attendance of\ncustomers. Good beef was in fair demand, and a good clearance\neffected, although prices rather favoured buyers. The mutton\ntrade was very slack, and sales could only be effected by submit-\nting to a decline of nearly id per lb. Beef, 6id to 6id per lb ;\nmutton, 6d to 6d. Cattle, 2,479; sheep, 15,652.\nSALFORD, SEPT. s.\u2014Beef trade was brisk at an advance on\nlast week. Inferior lamb and mutton 4cl per lb. lower, of which\nthere was a great number left unsold.

Number of beasts, 993 ; calves, 60 sheep and\nlambs, 11,120. _ _\n\nDUBLIN, SEPT. G.\u2014The market was rather a large one, high\nprices having brought forward considerable numbers of cattle\nand sheep. Prices were much the same as last week-558 to 65s\npa* cwt. in sink, for beef; top heifers a shade higher; single\nbeasts, 67s 6d ; mutton, 6d to 7d ; veal, lid per lb; lamb, season\nnearly out, IBs to 28s a3os each.

  "MENT TO THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.\n\nthey had acquired. But the eye of a vengeful\npeople never sleeps; they were intercepted by\nbands of Haiducs, Ouskoks, and Klepts, who\nunited to the peasants, now desperate, massacred\nevery soul that fell into their hands to the amount\nof several thousands, and so great was the booty,\nincluding weapons and ammunition, that the\nspoil of the Arnout is still a proverb, and the\nvictory the subject of many a spirit-stirring piesma\namong the Sclavonian bards and story-tellers.\nEncouraged by success, the insurrection may\nbe said to have only now commenced, several\ntowns and isolated forts successively fell into the\nhands of the insurgents. Sofia and Nissa, to-\ngether with many other important towns in Bul-\ngaria, were again besieged, and even Stamboul\nwas not secure, since the revolt had now spread\ninto Macedonia, Thessaly, and Candia ; and it\nmay with truth be said, that the fate of the\nOttoman Porte trembled in the balance, while\nthe humiliated sovereign, to preserve his rule,\nsaw himself obliged to seek the mediation of the\nPatriarch of Constantinople, and also that of the\nRussian Ambassador. The mediators between\nthe Sovereign and his people, in effecting a re-\nconciliation, were aided by the industrious habits\nof the Bulgarian tribes, whose love for home and\nsmiling fields prevailed over the excitement of\nglorious war, and they were again induced, by\nmany promises of ameliorating their social con-\ndition, to give up the contest.\u2014Spencer's Travels\nin European Turkey.\n",
  "THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.\n\ndismissed the other day in consequence of an inquiry entered\ninto by Cabouli Effendi, has a long and heavy reckoning to\ngive on this score.\n\nIn the month of October, the garrison of Kars was living on\nin a state of destitution. In November, famine was there.\nMost of the horses were eaten ; each man received a daily ra-\ntion of 80 drachms only, which is about the same as 250\ngrammes. For a long time past they have had no meat to eat. \u2022\nThis letter refers to the parley between General Williams\nand General Mouravieff, to the subsequent journey of Captain\nThompson to Erzeroum, and to the further communications\nbetween the Generals, ending, as the writer truly supposes,\nin a capitulation. In a postscript he states that an officer had\nlearnt from Captain Thompson's own lips a most horrible\naccount of the privations which the garrison of Kars had\nsuffered. In one week more than a thousand perished of\nsheer want.\n\nquotations of the 4th instant,-amounted to 6} cents per barrel.\nWheat has further declined 10c. to 15c. per bushel. Indian\ncorn is 4c. to sc. per bushel lower than on this day week.\nPROVISIONS.\u2014The downward tendency of the pork market\nstill continues, and prices have receded 25c. to'soc., with only\na limited demand, mainly for home use. The market for beef\ncontinues dull, and mess is rather easier. Prime mess con-\ntinues in good demand for export, and the market is steady.\nButter is in fair request. Cheese is selling at 94c. to 11ic.\nSALT.\u2014Liverpool was dull, and the quantity now on the way\nbeing large, for invoices, to arrive, lower prices were accepted.\nA sale of 1,600 sacks Ashton's fine, deliverable next month, has\nbeen made at $1,60, four months, but that price is not now\noffered.\n\nIRON.\u2014There was no new feature to notice, and the gen-\neral market was quiet. Small sales of Scotch pig had been\nmade at $30,50 to $3l, six months. English sheet there was\na fair stock of, but not well assorted. Singles scarce and\nhigher.\n\n-FREIGHTEL\u2014With increased offerings to Great Britain and\nthe Continent, and a limited supply of unengaged tonnage in\nport, the market is decidedly firmer ; in other directions there\nis no change to notice. The rates current are\u2014To Liverpool,\nfor cotton, id., to 9.32 d. per lb. \u2022 flour, 4s. per barrel ; grain,\n114 d to ls. per bushel. To London, flour, ss. per barrel ;\ngrain, ls. 2d. per bushel. To Havre, cotton, lc. per lb. ;\nflour, $1 per barrel; grain, 25c. per bushel.\nNEW ORLEANS.\u2014Cotton unchanged. Sales to-day, 6,500\nbales. Sugar has advanced 4c. on the better qualities. Mo-\nlasses declined Corn, 84c. to 874 c.\n",

  "THE APPROACHING HOLIDAYS.\n\nON Friday, the Appropriation Bill, which is usually\nconsidered the final measure of the session, was\nbrought in and read a first time in the House of Com-\nmons.

Even on Friday last, eight hours were occupied\nin discussing a senseless motion about the negotiations\nat Vienna, which resulted, as it might have been ex-\npected to result, in nothing but an adjournment at\nnearly two o'clock in the morning. The most import-\nant measure of the session will be the Appropriation\nBill, by which upwards of eighty-six millions has been\nvoted to the service of the Crown ; and when this is\npresented, at the prorogation, for the Royal Assent, it\nwill tell the tale most forcibly of the expensiveness of\nthe war, and the utter inability of the Commons of\nEngland to turn their attention to any other business.\nThe members of Parliament will be released from their\narduous duties to tell their constituents of the labours\nthey have undergone in prolonged sittings throughout\nthe night ; and, if any evidence be wanted of the atten-\ntion which they have besto.wed on the public service,\nthey may refer to the long speeches which have filled\nthe columns of the daily papers.\n",

  "SIR E. B. LYTTON'S MOTION.\n\nSir E. B. LYTTOY then rose and said that, in bringing for-\nward his resolution he hoped the house would be as indulgent\nto him as they had been to the noble lord, placed as he was\nunder the necessity of bringing forward a motioe against a\ngovernment which, but for the conduct of one of its members,\nwas entitled to their indulgence and commpassion. He then\nproceeded to criticies the noble lord's speech, who, he said, as\na member of the government, had called upon the country to\nspill its best blood in a war which he, as a negotiator, believed\nunnecessary. Adverting to the Vienna correspondence, he\nexpressed surprise that the noble lord had not retired from\nthe cabinet within a week after he returned. It was surpris-\ning that the noble lord at the head of the government had not\nseen that his government could not go on while its members\nwere so completely divided in opinion, as was apparent from\nthe correspondence that the Secretaay for the Colonies and the\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs were wholly at variance on the\nquestion of counterpoise. He (Sir. E. B. Lytton) gave a hearty\nconcurrence to the sound and healthy tone of Lord Claren-\ndon's correspondence, but how could Lord Palmerstone think\nof going on when he contrasted the opinions of that nobleman\nwith those of Lord J. Russell. Was Lord Clarendon to be\nconsidered the specimen of the Cabinet F Were they all\nunited\u2014were the first Lord of the Admiralty and the Chan-\ncellor of the Exchequer in unison with the rest of the Cabinet\nin carrying on the war ? The Cabinet was said tol3e united\nlast May, yet it was now admitted that there were differences\nof opinion ; and he would remark that a discussion like this\nwould scarcely be excused by the plea of expediency. He\nwould withdraw his motion, for all its objects had been at-\ntained.\n\nMr. BOUVERIE said that, as the motion had vanished into\nthin air, he would offer a few words upon a subject personal\nto himself. He had seen a statement that he was one of some\nmembers of the government who had waited upon Lord Pal-\nmerston, to say that they could not resist the motion of the\nhon. baaonet. The very reverse of that statement was the\ntruth. The fact was, that he had refused to be a party to\nsuch a representation, upon the distinct ground of his personal\nattachment to Lord J. Russell ; but he stated that, as a friend\nof the noble lord, he was ready, however painful it might be,\nto convey to him the general impression among his colleagues.\nIn this he thought he was acting as a true friend of the\nnoble lord\u2014(a laugh)\u2014and he was satisfied that his noble\nfriend fully appreciated the motives which led him to take\nsuch a step.

Still he did not think he had been so long absent\nas to forfeit his seat.\n\nMr. ATIEERTON, the Law-clerk, explained that the statute\ndeclared any seat forfeited, the occupant of which had been\nabsent for three consecutive months.

The fire of the enemy is weak.!'\n\nThe Times' Paris correspondent writes :\u2014\" A private letter\nfrom St. Petersburg mentions that great depression prevails\namong all classes in that city, owing to the duration of the\nwar, which completely paralyses all branches of commerce and\nindustry. This depression has gained even the leading per-\nsonages of the old Russian party, hitherto so warlike, but who\nare now beginning to despond. Nearly all labour is suspended\nin tlie manufacturing quarters, in consequence of the want of\nprimary materials, which no longer arrive from abroad, and\nalso from the want of hands\u2014all being employed in the defence\nof the empire. The produce of the soil has no longer a market\nabroad, and in the interior business is at a stand still, and\narticles of the most indispensable kind have attained an exor-\nbitant price. Coffee, sugar, and salt are now luxuries hardly\nto be seen, except on the sacrifice of money imposed by the\npresent circumstances; and the number of Bayards who will\nbe ruined by the war is beyond all idea.\"\n",

  "SCIENCE AND ART.\n\nARCHITECTURAL RESULTS OF PARIS EXHIBITION.\n\u2014The Great Exhibition of Paris, differing from that of\nLondon in several essential principles, has established,\naccordingly, several essentially different results. Among\nthe most remarkable of these is generally admitted to\nbe the decided superiority of the English school of\narchitecture ; a superiority which we never claimed,\nand which comes upon us by surprise. If we are de-\nficient in that brilliant but ephemeral taste which,\nanimated by a brighter sky, can make a street a gal-\nlery of the graces, or a square the garden of a palace, we\nare none the less supreme (so it appears) in our colder\nair, in that substantial and manly statuesque building\n\u2014aiming at less and succeeding in more\u2014that great\nart\u2014which through the ages marks the road of time,\nand writes the record of the just pride of nations, as\nin the hand of God they rise, and culminate, and fall.\nThere is a reason for everything, and a reason for this ;\nbut rather than discuss the unsuspected cause, let us\nadopt the grateful result, and affirm at once that it is\nobviously worthy of exertion to follow it up.\u2014Builder\nPUBLIC WORKS AT CLOSE OF LAST WAR.\u2014In 1814\nthe allied sovereigns were in London, and there was a\ngeneral thanksgiving for what was anticipated would\nbe the permanent ratification of peace. Projects of\nall kinds were discussed within the peaceful haven of\nCarlton House, and the Prussian monarch despatched\nto the architect Schinkel, then rising into fame, a\ncommand to make designs for a grand cathedral, to\ncommemorate the pacification of Europe. But the\ntime for either commemorative or useful public works\nhad hardly yet arrived, and with the exception of the\ncommencement of Southwark-bridge, the enthusiasm\nof 1814 left little more than a pagoda\" in St.\nJames's-park, and the ricketty \" Chinese bridge,\" of\nwhich the London world has lately heard something.\nDuring the year 1815, however, there were some im-\nportant undertakings. The Mint, on Tower-hill, by\nSir Robert Smirke, was erected, and the London In-\nstitution, by the late W. Mclntosh Brooks, was com-\nmenced in Finsbury-circus, which was formed on the\nremoval of old Bethlehem Hospital. In these build-\nings the English version of pseudo-Greek architec-\nture is seen fully established. The new Bethlehem\n",

The Naval Estimates are\nmainly made up of the cost of naval stores, Sr.c.; for the\nbuilding and repairs of ships, which amounts to \u00a31,063;063.\nThe remaining items consist of \u00a361,503 for new works, im-\nprovements, and repairing yards, and some small sums for\nwages, medical stores, &c.

  "lectual being, he will not consider it as a duty or\na delight that belongs only to man, but will feel\nit more delightful, as there is now another soul\nthat may share with him all the pleasure of the\nprogress. To love the happiness of her whose\nhappiness is in his affection, is, of course, to be\nconjugally faithful ; but it is more than to be\nmerely faithful ; it is not to allow room even for\na doubt as to that fidelity, at least for such a\ndoubt as a reasonable mind might form. It is\ntruly to love her best ; but it is also to seem to\nfeel that love which is truly felt.\nAs the happiness of the wife is the rule of\nconjugal duty to the husband, the happiness of\nthe husband is in like manner the rule of con\u2014\njugal duty to the wife. There is no human being\nwhose affection is to be to her like his affection,\nas there is no happiness which is to be to her like\nthe happiness which he enjoys. All which I\nhave said of the moral obligation of the husband,\nthen, is not less applicable to her duty ; but,\nthough the gentle duties belong to both, it is to\nher province that they more especially belong,\nbecause she is at once best fitted by nature for\nthe ministry of tender courtesies, and best exer-\ncised in the office that inspires them. While man\nis occupied in other cares during the business of\nthe day, the business of her day is but the con-\ntinued discharge of many little duties that have\na direct relation to wedlock, in the common\nhousehold which it has formed. He must often\nforget her, or be useless to the world ; she is most\nuseful to the world by remembering him. From\nthe tumultuous scenes which agitate many of his\nhours, he returns to the calm scenes where peace\nawaits him, and happiness is sure to await him\nbecause she is there waiting whose smile is peace,\nand whose very presence is more than happiness\nto his heart.\nHere Love his golden shaft employs, here lights\nHis constant lamp, and waves his purple wings\u2014\nHere reigns and revels.\n\nThe vows which constitute a solemn part of\nthe matrimonial engagement give to this duty of\nreciprocal love the sanction of an additional\nauthority ; but they only give an additional sanc-\ntion, and increase the guilt of violating duties\nwhich, without these vows, it would still have\nbeen guilt to violate.\u2014Professor Brown's Lectures.\n",

The announcement was so\npositively made, and at the same time appeared so\nprobable, that it was generally believed; but the same\nnight the Ministers in both Houses of Parliament\ntook especial pains to deny its accuracy, affirming that\nthe indisposition of Lord RAGLAN was but temporary,\nand that there was reason to hope a few days only\nwould restore him to his ordinary health, as the last\naccounts stated that he was considerably better. This\nwas reassuring to those who viewed with some appre-\nhension a change in the chief command of our army at\nthis critical period of the war ; but not many hours\nelapsed when the public were startled by an official\nannouncement from Lord PANMErIiE, the Minister of\nWar, that, instead of being considerably better, the\nCommander-in-Chief was actually dead. It was so\nsudden, following so quickly after the other state-\nments, that it was scarcely credited, until the nature\nof the communication left no room for further doubt.\nWhatever may have been the error of the Ministers\nin imposing so arduous a duty upon a man so far ad-\nvanced in life as Lord RAGLAN, and who had never\nbefore had the command of an army, there are few will\ndispute that he performed the task entrusted to him\nto the best of his ability. Any deficiency in energy,\neither mental or physical, was the necessary conse-\nquence of age; and if some blame might be attached to\nhis management of details, we must not overlook the\nfaults of the system in which he had been trained, and\nthe difficulty at his age of adapting long-taught ex-\nperience to modern requirements. His knowledge of\nwarfare was learned under the Great Master of the\nArt in a former age ; and, after forty years' repose, it\nwas a gallant devotion of himself to the call of his\ncountry, at a time of need, to leave the ease, which he\nhad nobly earned, to undergo the fatigues and priva-\ntions of a campaign in the Crimea. He is entitled to\nthe grateful remembrance of his countrymen ; and\n",

Frequently small portions of\nstone were let in in addition to the enamel : among\nothers, .a choice example, protected by a thick crystal,\noccurs in Alfred's jewel in the museum at Oxford.\nChamp-leve enamel, which succeeded the previous,\nwas treated differently, and afforded a greater variety\nof capabilities, from the fact that a subject being\ntraced upon the metal (generally copper), the ground-\nwork was carved out with small tools, leaving more or\nless of the metal standing, according to the develop-\nment required : the ground was then filled with\npowdered enamel, which, being fused, was subse-\nquently ground off, polished and gilt. Another mode\nconsisted of the surface being engraved or chased, in\nincised patterns, as before, filled with the various\nopaque enamels, and among these some peculiar\ncolours, which are only just being revived. And\nwhere spaces had been previously left, having the\noutline form of the figure preserved, a subject in low\nrelief was attached on the surface of the metal.

  "Rroy.\n\nThe correspondent of the Morning Herald, writing on the\nIst of December, says, in respect to the\nRUSSIAN FIRE FROM THE NORTH SIDE :\nAlthough the desultory firing against the town of Sebas-\ntopol scarcely requires notice, that against the Malakoff is a\nnovelty that must not remain unrecorded. During the whole\nperiod since their retreat from the southern shore of the har-\nbour, the Russians have daily thrown shot and shell from the\nnorth side upon the points occupied by the allies, yet in so\nuseless a manlier, and at such long intervals, that the damage\ndone proved unimportant. But since I last wrote you, and in\norder, perhaps, to wind up November with some \u00e9clat, the\nenemy, especially on Thursday\u2014the anniversary of the Polish\nrevolution, 1830 \u2014maintained so unexpected and so very heavy\nafire upon the Malakoff, that the French were almost tempted\nto return it. But they did not. Their officers ordered them\nto keep under shelter in the very \" bomb-proofs\" into which\nthe fire of the allies had so often driven the Russians, prior to\nthe capture of that work on Saturday, the Bth of September.\nTo this fire on the Malakoff the French disdained to return a\nsingle shot. The allies have not fired for weeks. \" Wait a\nwee,\" as the Scotch proverb has it, and Prince Gortschakoff\nwill find a few new batteries open upon him, which will more\nthan compensate for our present non-acknowledgment of his\nfavours. ;Yesterday, St. Andrew's-day, broke with so fine a\nfrost'and clear a sky, that a renewed cannonade was expected,\nbut this did not occur, and, soon after noon, heavy rain, which\nstill continues, again set in, and \"not a gun was heard,\" nor\nwas there \" a funeral note.\" The Russians seldom hit us, and\ntherefore waste their ammunition most ridiculously. Some\npeople imagine all this present fierceness on their part but pre-\ncedes a pre-arranged retreat. I cannot myself think so ; and\nI imagine they are preparing for some mysterious \"dash\" in\nor near the harbour of Sebastopol, for we can perceive a good\nmany boats and rafts under the north shore. N' imports, all\nIs ready for their reception, and perhaps the boats may be\ncollected merely to be burnt some day, or, as the fleet was,\nbut to be sunk.\n",
  "THE LIVERPOOL STANDARD.\n\nOPERATIONS IN THE BALTIC.\n\nThe following are extracts from the correspondence\nof the Times, dated off Cronstadt, July 4th :---\n\nThe Cuckoo arrived at noon with despatches for the Com-\nmander-in-Chief. She brings word that along the coast\nbetween Nystadt and Christianstadt the -squadron had de-\nstroyed 53 large ships, amounting to more than 20,000 tons.\nThe blockade of the whole coast as far up as Tornea, will be\ndeclared in a few days. It would have been done before had\nvessels of the class required been at the Admiral's command.\nJuly 6th.\u2014At 9.30 a.m., the Geyser, which had been sent\nto take the James Watt's place as a look-out ship to the west-\nward, observed some troops marching along the coast, and\nopened fire upon them with shell; they immediately threw away\ntheir fire-arms and heavy helmets, and fled in all directions to\nthe woods. At 10.30 a.m. the Princess Alice proceeded\ntowards Cronstadt with a flag of truce, and bearing a letter\nfrom the Commander-in-Chief to the Russian Minister-of-\nWar. She was met by a steamer from the harbour, who\nreceived the despatch, and both vessels returned. Every day,\nSundays not excepted, the enemy exercise the mortar batte-\nries along the northern sea wall. Some of the mortars have\nan immense range.\n",

  "EMENT TO THE LIVERPOOL STAN:\n\nsize (and roughly reduced to a globular shape, which\nhave doubtless been intended to be used as ammunition\nfor the ballistm The chief value of the inscription,\nhowever, consists in the evidence which it affords of\nthe presence in Britain of a Roman proprietor, of\nwhom the tablets previously discovered are nearly\nsilent\u2014Claudius Paulinus. One of the slabs discovered\nby the Duke of Northumberland on the occasion re-\nferred to, and engraved in the second edition of Bruce's\nRoman Wall, contains a name resembling that of\nPaulinus, but, unfortunately, a fracture in the stone\nrenders it indistinct. On comparing the two inscrip-\ntions, which are of the same character, and evidently\nbelong to the same age, there can be no doubt that\nthe august functionary named upon them both is Clau-\ndius Paulinus. Mr. Roach Smith, in the third vo-\nlume of his Collectanea Antigua, gives an inscription\nfound. at Vieux, in France, which mentions Claudius\nPauhnus, and among other particulars respecting him\nstates that he was imperial legate and proprietor of\nthe province of Lyons, and afterwards of the province\nof Britain. No doubt the individual referred to in\nboth cases is the same. It is interesting to observe\nthat, while the soldiers of England and France are\nfighting side by side in the East, the peaceful exca-\nvators of both nations are, in the west, concentrating\nthe rays of historic truth upon the footprints of the\ngreat people who taught them both how to make war\nand how to govern. Several fragments of glass and\npottery, some of them of unsual types, have been found.\nOn a hill to the south of the Rede-water, and con-\nfronting that on which the Roman camp stands, are\ndistinct traces of an ancient British fortification.

  "THE WAR.\n\nTHE winter appears to have all but completely stopped the\nprogress of hostilities in the Crimea, and the correspondents\nof the London journals now find occupation in chronicling\nthe amusements by which the troops seek to beguile the\n\ntedium of comparative inactivity and idleness, varied occa-\nsionally with details of winter storms and boisterous weather.\n\nThe special correspondent of the Times, writing from the\ncamp before Sebastopol, on the 30th of November, makes the\nfollowing remarks on\nTHE MUD OF THE CRIMEA.\n\nWe are all ancle-deep in mud. No, that would be nothing.\nIt would be no great matter of complaint or grievance if we\nhad to deal with the ordinary material, so familiar to all\nLondoners after a few wet days, before the scavengers remove\nthe formidable soft parapets which line the kerbstones. That\ncan be scraped off, cleaned, rubbed away, or washed out.\nThis nothing but long and persevering efforts, continually\nrenewed, and combining all the former operations, can remove.\nIt sticks in pasty clods to the shoes, and will insist on being\nbrought into clean huts and tents to visit your friends. It\nhas a great affection for straws, with which it succeeds in\nworking itself up into a kind of gigantic brick, somewhat\nunderdone, in which condition it threatens to build your\nlegs into the ground if you stand long enough in\none place to give it a chance ; and it mightily affects\nhorseshoes also, and sucks them off with a loud\nsmaek of relish in those little ravines between rocky\nhill sides, in which it exercise the greatest influence.\nLiterally and truly it is like glue half boiled and spread over\nthe. faee of the earth for the depth of several feet. It is no\nioke for a soldier to see his sleeping place, in hut or tent,\ncovered with this nasty slime ; but they cannot be kept clean.\nOne step outside, and you are done for. The mud is lying in\nwait for you, and you just carry as much back on your feet\nas if you walked a mile. Carts stick immoveably in the\nground, or the wheels and axles fly into pieces from the strain\nof the horses and mules, which have led a wretched existence,\nindeed, ever since this weather began. As I write, the air re-\nsounds with the noise of the blows inflicted on the heads, sides,\nand legs of the miserable quadrupeds drawing fuel and stores\nfrom the commissariat depot of the division.\nHe continues his narrative on the 4th of December, and\nthus speaks of the\n",

  "MEMOIR OF ZARIF PACHA.\n\nWhere Zarif Pacha first saw the light of day, history has\nomitted to record. He passed in early youth through that\nimperial road to success in Turkey\u2014the slave market.\nRizza Pacha, the present seraskier, became his master,\nand in the harem of that dignitary the future muchir de-\nveloped those intellectual and moral faculties that shone\nforth subsequently in so pleasing a manner. The first\nbloom of youth had passed over the cheeks of the little\nZarif when he made his second step in the world by ap-\npearing as chiboulciee, or pipe-bearer, in the train of his\nmaster. As the youthful Zarif increased in size and years,\nthe desire of his owner that the state should profit by the\nservices of his protege, resulted in the gift.of a civil ap-\npointment to Zarif Effendi, whose political and social ca-\nreer thus commenced. In similar cases it, however,\ngenerally occurs, that the faithful chiboukgee, or aspiring\nbarber, is rewarded with a captaincy or majority in the\narmy, where, in good time, he obtains, either by intrigue\nor purchase, the rank of Pacha.

  "MINISTERIAL FAVOURITISM.\n\nDuring the dissensions which prevailed in the ministry, be-\nfore the death of Queen Anne, the Tories ( professors of the\npresent principles of Whiggism ) were desirous of securing for\ntheir friends some of the more valuable offices in the patronage\nof government. The mastership of the mint-was one of those\nwhich they thought within their reach, and the scheme of re-\nleasing Sir Isaac from the labours of his office, and thus giving\nhim more leisure for the prosecution of his studies, seemed to\nbe one that was likely to meet with general approbation. It\nwas resolved, therefore, to offer him a pension \u00a32,000, on the\ncondition that he resigned the mastership of the mint, the,\nsalary of which was only about half that sum ; and Dr. Swift'\nwas commissioned by Bolingbroke, one of the secretaries of\nstate, to propose the plan to Mrs. Catherine Barton, the parti-\ncular friend of Swift, and the favourite niece of Newton. The,\nliberality of the offer might have tempted ordinary function-,\naries, but it met with a very different reception from Newton,\nwho saw at once the character and object of the proposal.'\nWhen Mrs. Barton communicated to him the message from\nBolingbroke, Sir Isaac replied, \"My place is at their service,\nbut I will have no pension.\"\n\nIn the compilation of the book, Sir David Brewster\nhas manifested much diligence and a considerable\namount of forbearance. He has also exerted himself\ngreatly to show a full assemblage of all the facts con-\nnected with the personal history of his hero ; but,\nwhile doing this, he has scarcely succeeded in doing,\nmore than producing a book which will immensely aid\nin enabling some future biographer to write a syste-\nmatised and digested life of Sir Isaac Newton, a work\nstill greatly needed. ---\nPersonal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medi2zalt\nand llfeceah. By Richard. F. Burton. London :\nLongman and Co.\n\nBooks of oriental travel have of late years become so\ncommon as to be looked on with little relish ; but from\nthis generally-deserved listlessness of appreciation, Mr.\nBurton's book is entitled to honourable exception.\nThe scene of his wanderings is new to European eyes.\nWandering in a really strange land, our adventurous\nauthor saw strange sights, and these he narrates With\nfresh and racy energy. He combines instructive nar-\nrative with a fine spirit of wild adventure; and, suit-\ning his somewhat unbending English habits to those\nof native orientals, he so completely imbibes the spirit-\nof their life and habits, as to be easily mistaken for one\nof the eastern wanderers with whom he associated.\nA successful assumption of this character was indis-\npensable in attaining the object he had in view; no\nEuropean, or at all events no unbeliever in the\n",

Sir\n.Colin Campbell returns home on private affairs, and it has\nbeen said that professional jealousy is one of the causes of his\nreturn. There are two other general officers senior to the\nCommander-in-Chief, General Barnard and Lord Rokeby.\nWe sincerely hope that no considerations of etiquette will in-\nduce them to abandon at once the posts they hold, and their\nfair prospects of high distinction. Sir Richard Airey, the\nQuartermaster-General, also returns home. He is junior to\nGeneral Codringfon, and, of course, can have no cause of com-\nplaint.

This condition, however, is one which\nwill require to be narrowly watched. Misplaced partiality,\nwhim, or individual influence, may be so readily brought to\nbear on-the expenditure of such a fund, that zealous watch-\nfiness alone can secnre its satisfactory outlay. By one\nPortion of the new.arrangements Sir CHARLES EASTLAKE has\nbeen appointed director, with authority, independent of and\nparamount to that of the trustees, as to the purchase of any\npicture or collection. The director, in terms of his appoint.\nment, is required to lay an annual report before Parliament,\nso that the affairs and condition of the National Gallery will\nbe brought yearly under supervision of the House of Com-\nmons.

It is glorious, rich, glowing, extatic, says one ; it is\nbeautiful, chaste, and stately, says another. Within the last\nfew years so many thefts and spurious snatches have been\nmade of APOLLO'S fire, that the announcement of a new\nclaimant for poetic fame is met with an ominous shake of the\nhead by the sagacious\u2014the doubt implied being magnified\nin its portent in proportion to the brazen sounds which have\nbeen made to herald the candidate's approach. What between\nBIGGS, SMITHS, and BAILEYS-, and their noisy trumpeters,\nthe poetic circle has been kept in: a perfect uproar for years\npast, and a modest minstrel who, should rely upon his merits\nis rudely hustled out of the arena. Tn the midst of the chaos\nso created, it is refreshing, as well as-inspiriting, to meet with\na song in which nature is allowed to, walk on the earth, wan-\ndering among meadows, and flowers, and woods, and associated\nwith well-conditioned human beings, instead of being whisked\naway into\u2022 the region of broken suns, stray planets-, and lunatic\nstars,.holding converse with misanthropic. angels and saints of\nmore than\u2022 doubtful purity.

  "THE HARVEST.\n\nSo much of national prosperity depends upon the\nabundance of the harvest, that it is gratifying to notice\nthe really beautiful weather with which Providence\nhas lately blessed the nation. It has come at what\nmay be called the' latter end of the harvest ; but it\nmust be remembered that this is of the greater im-\nportance, inasmuch as it is the late districts which\nordinarily suffer most from unfavourable weather. It\nhas enabled the farmers to get in their corn in the\nbest possible condition, and at the same time to banish\nthose apprehensions which were at one time enter-\ntained of the re-appearance of disease in the potato\ncrop. The latter 'esculent enters largely into the food\nof the population, and whatever may be the statements\nmade by those whose interests are to keep up prices,\nthe public may\n,judge for themselves ,cf their falsity\nby the quality of the potatoes which they consume.\nThese are nOtoriously what is called mealy, and it is a\nwell-known 'fact that the tendency ,of the disease is to\ninjure or destroy this quality ; so that it may confi-\ndently be Assumed that this crop 'hos not been in better\ncondition since the first appearance of this mysterious\ndisorder about nine years ago. The effect will neces-\nsarily le to diminish the consumption of wheat ; and -as\nthe latter article has been kept at a high price, owing\nto the demands for the continent, where the harvest,\nthough late, is now being gathered in good condition,\nwe may reasonably anticipate that recent high prices,\nwlach have already begunito give way, will very shortly\nconsiderably reduced.\nThe reports from Ameiica concur in representations\nof a most abundant yield of the wheat harvest, and the\nprice of flour in the New York market has 'very ra-\npidly fallen. The downfal of the Russian power in the\nBlack Sea will open the resources of the Danube for\nlarge supplies from that quarter ; so that, with our own\nharvest, which is row acknowledged by competent\nauthorities to be above an average, in addition to the\nmuch greater breadth of land in wheat, 'there ought\nto be no fears as to a sufficiency of food for the popu-\nlation. The fine weather will have added materially\nto the resources \u20226f the country, enabling us so much\nthe better to bear the heavy burdens rendered neces-\nsary by the war ; and even the pressure on the money\nmarket will not be without a good effect, because it\n' will impose a Wholesome restriction on the operations\nof mere speculators, who look for their gains from\nnational distress.\n",

James Baines and Co. the sum of\n\u00a3l6 10s., being wages at the rate of \u00a34 10s. per month, on\nboard of the Ocean Chief, from this port to Sydney. It ap-\npeared that on arriving at Sydney, the Commodore Perry,\nanother of Messrs. Baines and Co.'s ships, was lying there\nshort of men. Captain Tobin, of the Ocean Chief, asked if\nany of his men would volunteer to go in her to Bombay for\n\u00a32O. Eight agreed to do so ; but Captain Tobin refused to\ngive them either their discharge or their wages for the voyage\nfrom Liverpool to Sydney. The men, however, sailed to Bom-\nbay in the Commodore Perry, where each was paid his \u00a32O,\nand returned to Liverpool in another vessel. Mr. Forshaw,\nfor the defence, argued that when sailors make extra large\nwages by volunteering from one ship to another, it was not\ncustomary to pay them the wages in the first ship, as they\nmade more money by leaving her than by remaining in her.\nMr. Mansfield said he would adjournthe case till he had taken\nthe opinion of an experienced shipmaster on the subject, par-\nticularly with reference to the articles of release,\n",
  "FASHIONS.\n\nGREAT varieties of elegant out-door costumes are constantly\nappearing at the French Universal Exposition. Among the\nmost admired of the dresses worn last week, we may mention\none of pearl grey barege. It was trimmed with flounces, each\nbordered by two white bands or stripes woven in the barege,\nand these bands were figured with wreaths of roses in natural\ncolours. The corsage, which was high and with a basque, was\nfastened in front by five rosettes of white ribbon figured with\nbouquets of roses ; and up each side of the front three stripes,\nsimilar to those on the flounces, passed from the point at the\nwaist to the shoulders. Between these stripes the barege was\ngathered in transversal folds. The sleeves were trimmed with\nthree deep frills looped up by rosettes of ribbon, and the frills,\nas well as the basque, was edged with a stripe corresponding\nwith those on the flounces. The collar and under-sleeves were\nof guipure. The mantilla worn with this dress was of white\nguipure. It was of small size, descending only to the waist,\nand was trimmed by three rows of scolloped lace, fixed one\nabove the other, on a fall of tulle. The body of the mantilla\nwas edged round by a bouillonne with pink ribbon passed\nunder it ; and upon the bouillonne rosettes of black velvet\nwere placed at the distance of two or three inches apart. Each\nfrill of lace was headed by bouillonne, and rosettes of velvet.\nThe bonnet which completed this costume was of plain French\nchip, trimmed simply by a bow of white sarsenet ribbon with\nfringed ends. The under-trimming consisted of bouillonnes\nof blonde and sprigs of flowers of various colours.\nThough no material change in the form of bonnets has\nlately taken place, we may mention one or two of the most\nnovel which have just appeared. One is composed of bouil-\nlonnes of a crape of a bright dark-blue tint, with intermediate\nbands of straw guipure. Small loops of narrow black velvet\nribbon are so disposed as to fall at intervals over the bands of\nstraw guipure. On one side of the bonnet is placed a bouquet\nof monkshood formed of crape with foliage of black velvet.\nThe inside trimming consists of bouillonnes of white blonde\nintermingled with light sprays of foliage in black velvet and\nbuds of monkshood; the light blonde trimming has the effect\nof softening the bright blue of the flower buds, and on the\nwhole, the under-trimming of this bonnet is very becoming.\nAmong the bonnets most reinarkable for novelty is one com-\nposed of black lace and cerise-colour velvet, and trimmed with\npoppies and blackberries. A bonnet of white crape has been\ntrimmed with roses and black velvet; to the edge of this\nbonnet is attached a fall of black Chantilly lace. A very\npretty and becoming bonnet is formed of bands of French\nchip and bouillonnes of blonde, trimmed with tufts of the\nlarge blue flowers, called the iris, or flag.\u2014 The Lady's News-\npaper.\n",

  "THE MINISTERIAL VACANCIES.\n\nWHEN Lord PALMERSTON was elevated into the\nposition of Prime Minister, in seeming accordance\nwith the popular voice, we disputed his claim to the\ndistinction, upon the ground that, notwithstanding\nthe length of his official career, he had never displayed\nany greater ability than in making plausible excuses\nfor the errors he had committed. His popularity, as\nfar as the public at large is concerned, has long since\ndwindled away, and the estimation in which he is held\nby the leading men of parties seems still more illusory.\nHe commenced his career as Premier by a coalition\nwith the Peelites, who quickly seceded from the alli-\nance ; he took into his Cabinet his bitterest political\nfoe, who was subsequently dismissed with ignominy\nhceasssittyw,oheimfilpleodrtathnet\nhighest offices of the State with men untried and\nyhene\nforal m hisos t t\nunknownr each e r y ; coamndpelnleodwb\nstations vacant, and is apparently at his wit's end to\nfind men of respectability to fill them. The office of\nColonial Secretary has been offered to Lord STANLEY,\nand, notwithstanding the alleged Radical predilections\nof the heir of the House of DERBY, he has declined\nthe proffered honour, upon the advice, it is believed, of\nhis Conservative father. A re-opening of negotiations\nwith the Peelites has been talked of ; but this will\nnot strengthen public confidence in a Ministry already\nsuspected of deficiency of zeal to carry on the war ;\nand as the next resort is to the obscurity from which\nthe Premier has already recruited his ranks, it is not\nsurprising that an appeal to the people by a dissolution\nof Parliament should be seriously discussed as a neces-\nsity almost inevitable. It is a result of the present\nposition of affairs, which seems by no means improba-\nble ; and it behoves the Conservatives throughout. the\nkingdom to be well-prepared to take full advantage of\nit. There can be little doubt that if the intelligence\nand sound common-sense of the electoral body be\nfairly appealed to, they will welcome the accession of\na Conservative Ministry, which can only be accom-\nplished by returning Conservative members to the\nHouse of Commons. Sufficient experience must have\nbeen acquired of the folly of trusting to Radicals or\nPeelites, through whose mismanagement the war has\nproved a greater evil than it need have done. Much\nhas yet to be accomplished before we can hope to wit-\nness a return to peace upon a lasting foundation ; but\nthe people may be assured of this, that the most\ncertain means of achieving the object will be found\nto be under the auspices of a Conservative Adminis-\ntration.\n",

The result was this, that we\nfound nothing in the whole city worthy of being\nmeasured and drawn architecturally' (by which\nI mean outlined with the scrupulous accuracy of\nmeasurement usually adopted by architects) ex-\ncept the two theatres and the amphitheatre,\npicturesque sketches and notes of the other sub-\njects of interest being quite sufficient for our\nobject.\n\" On Friday morning we commenced, and by\nour united efforts have completed the measure-\nment of the small theatre, which, by the by, was\nunquestionably an odium.

  "THE RAFT BRIDGE IN THE HARBOUR,\n\nThe object of the great beams of timber and waggon loads\nof planks, for a long time past observed to be brought to the\nnorth side, and also in considerable quantities across to the\nsouth side, becomes more apparent daily. The raft bridge\nbefore alluded to is now brought nearly opposite to Fort Paul,\nand can be seen occupying the space which is left vacant be-\nhind the second three-decker and the two-decker in the line\nof ships stretching across the roadstead. In a few days it will\nbe completed to Fort Nicholas. Troops will then be able to\nwalk across from Fort Katherine or Fort Sukaia, as it is\nmarkedin the maps, to the south side in a continuous body.\nThe workmen are busily employed upon the bridge. As each\nraft is added to the length already formed, it is firmly an-\nchored down and connected. It seems to be very solidly con-\nstructed, floats some distance above the water, is broad, and\nwould appear to be calculated to sustain the passage of heavy\ntrucks or carts, as well as of men. The workmen are now\noccupied in fixing rails on each side for the protection of the\npassengers. The roof of the very large building, connecting\nthe barrack and admiralty buildings, and facing the south\nharbour, has been completely stripped and taken away, and\nthere is very little doubt that this has been done in order to\nemploy its rafters as some of the supports for the planking of\nthe bridge just mentioned. It has been suspected that this\ntimber had been used in constructing some casemating, or\nother works, within the barrack building, but this idea is now\nabandoned. - _ _\n",
  "THE BATTLE OF KARS.\n\nFOREIGN-OFFICE, Nov. 10.\nThe Earl of Clarendon has received a despatch from Major\n-\nGeneral Williams, Her Majesty's Commissioner with the\nTurkish Army in Asia, of which the following is a copy :\"\nKARS, Oct, 3.\nMy Lord,\u2014l had the honour to announce to your Lordship,\non the evening of the 29th ult., the glorious victory gained on\nthe morning of that day by the Sultan's troops on the heights\nabove Kars, over the Russian army commanded by General\nMuravieff, andi now beg to furnish your Lordship with the\nprincipal incidents of that sanguinary battle.\nYour Lordship will, perhaps, recollect that in my despatch,\nNo. 123, of the 26th of June, I stated that the Russian Gene-\nral, after his second demonstration against the southern face\nof our entrenchments, which is Ranked by Hafiz Pasha Tabia\nand Kanli Tabia, marched south, and established his camp at\nBugah Tikine, a village situated alfout four miles from Kars.\nKnowing that General Muravieff served in the army which\ntook Kars in 1828, I conceived his last manoeuvre to be pre-\nparatory either to a reconnaissance, or an attack upon the\nheights of Tahmasb, whence the Russians successfully pushed\ntheir approaches in the year above cited.\nWhile, therefore, the enemy's columns were in march to-\nwards Bugah Tikme, I visited those heights with Lieutenant-\nColonel Lake, and, after studying the ground, decided upon\nthe nature of the works to be thrown up ; these were planned\nand executed by Lieutenant-Colonel Lake with great skill and\nenergy. I enclose for your Lordship's information a plan\nmade by that officer of the town and its neighbouring\nheights, which are situated on the opposite side of the river of\nKars Chi, over which three temporary bridges had been -\nthrown to keep up our communications. As all verbal des-\ncriptions or bird'seye views of ground convey but an imperfect\nidea of any locality, I beg to enclose a sketch made by Mr.\nChurchill, which will, I trust, tend to elucidate my descrip-\ntion..\n\nYour Lordship will observe that, while our camp and ma-\ngazines in the town were rendered as safe as circumstances\nwould allow, the hills above Kars commanded all, and were,\ntherefore, the keys of our position.\nThe intrenchments of Tahmasb, being those nearest the\nenemy's camp, demanded the greatest vigilance from all in-\ntrusted with their defence. General Kmety, a gallant Hun-\ngarian officer, commanded the division which occupied this\neminence ; he was assisted by Major-General Hussein Pasha\nmid my- Aide-de-Camp, Major Teesdale, who has acted as his\nChief of the Staff'.\n",

  "VAUXHALL WARD.\n\nMr. John Moss, the retiring member, has gone to reside in\nthe Isle of Man, and the burgesses had to select a gentleman\nin his place. Mr. Thomas Chalmer, surgeon, who formerly\nrepresented the ward, and has also sat for Everton, was the\nfirst candidate in the field. Mr. Roger Haydock, lime-burner,\n&c., was subsequently nominated, and the contest lay between\nthese gentlemen. When the poll closed, the numbers were\u2014\nfor Mr. Haydock, 145 ; for Mr. Chalmer, 138.\n\nST. PAUL'S WARD.\n\nThe Radicals in this ward made a desperate attempt to oust\nMr. Godfrey, bringing forward Mr. J. B. Spence, to oppose\nhim. The contest was very close throughout the whole of the\nday, but at four o'clock Mr. Godfrey was announced to have a\nmajority of 43.\nCASTLE-STREET WARD.\n\nThis ward, which has always been considered \" safe\" by the\nRadicals, has been most unexpectedly wrested from them this\nyear, the election having ousted Mr. Avison, the retiring mem-\nber, and chosen Mr. J. G. Livingston, a Conservative. From\n-the commencement of the voting, Mr. Livingston had a ma-\njority ; but, increasing from hour to hour, till the numbers at\nthe poll stood, for Mr. Livingston, 298; for Mr. Avison, 252 ;\nleaving the former a clear majority of 46 votes.\nShortly after four o'clock, Mr. G. W. Moss, chairman of Mr.\nLivingston's committee, announced, from a window of the\ncommittee-room, at the Tiger Inn, Dale-street, the state of the\npoll at the close to be 298 for Mr. Livingston, and 252 for Mr.\nAvison.\u2014Mr. Livingston then came forward, and said : I am\ntold, gentlemen, that on these occasions it is not expected that\nthe candidate should make any formal declaration of his prin-\nciples, or, in fact, that he should do more than thank those of\nhis brother electors who have worked so earnestly and with\nsuch zeal to place him in such a tremendous majority, I may\nsay, for this ward\u2014( hear, hear)\u2014because I am told\u2014and\nthere are men in this room who are older than I am, who can\ncorrect me if I am wrong\u2014but I believe that since the passing\nof the Municipal Bill, in 1835, this ward has never been repre-\nsented except by men of extreme Radical principles. ( Hear.)\nSome weeks ago, when I was about to leave town, I did make\nsome endeavour to wrest this ward from the hands of the Ra-\ndicals\u2014( hear, hear)\u2014and I then said to a gentleman, who is\nnow present, \"It is not my wish to go into the Town Council ;\nbut I think every man should play his part when called upon,\nand, if you cannot find a candidate, my services are at your\ndisposal.

  "LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.\n\nBOYLE v. WrsEmAILL-At the Croydon Assizes a new trial\nin this case was fixed for to-day, but after a consultation\nbetween the counsel it was postponed till to-morrow, but it is\nunderstood that it will be settled; the\n.Cardinal probably\npaying all the costs, including the damages given to Mr.\nBoyle at Kingston Assizes.\n\nTHE WAR.\n\nDESPATCH FROM GENERAL SIMPSON:\n\nThe Gazette contains a despatch from General iiMpson\ndated 31st July.\n\nNotwithstanding the rocky nature of the gronnd.and light-\nness of the nights, the works were steadily thirugh slowly\nadvanced in the direction of the Redan.\n\nAn agreeable change had taken place in the weather ; heavy\nshowers of rain had occasionally fallen.\n\nSeveral reconnaissances had been made from the Valley of\nBaidar towards Ozenbash, Aitodor, and through Phoros Pass\ntowards Allupka\u2014the enemy nowhere appearing in any force;\nbut the narrowness of the mountain road, with the exception_\nof the Woronzow, makes it unnecessary for them to alter their\nconcentrated position on the heights of Mackenzie and the\nPlateau of the Belbeck.\nHealth of the troops continued satisfactory..\n\nCasualties from 27th to 29th July, inclusive .\u2014Killed, 1\nsergeant and 11 rank and file.

The fire of the enemy is weak.\"\n\nThe Times' Paris correspondent, writes :\u2014\" A private letter\nfrom St. Petersburg mentions that great depression prevails\namong all classes in that city, owing to the duration of the\nwar, which completely paralyses all branches of commerce and\nindustry. This depression has gained even the leading per-\nsonages of the old Russian party, hitherto so warlike, but who\nare now beginning to despond. Nearly all labour is suspended\nin the manufacturing quarters, in consequence of the want of\nprimary materials, which no longer arrive from abroad, and\nalso from the want of hands\u2014all being employed in the defence\nof the empire. The produce of the soil has no longer a market\nabroad, and in the interior business is at a stand still, and\narticles of the most indispensable kind have attained an exor-\nbitant price. Coffee, sugar, and salt are now luxuries hardly,\nto be seen, except on the sacrifice of money imposed by the\npresent circumstances; and the number of Bayards who will.\nbe ruined by the war is beyond all idea.\"\n",

With regard to-the second question,\nit could not be denied, though recruiting was going on at the\nrate of 1,000 men a-,,,veek, that the total force of the British\narmy was far below the amount voted by .parliament. The\ngovernment had therefore determined to endeavour to make\nthe service more attractive by giving double pay to every sol-\ndier actively engaged before the enemy. This additional :pay\nit was proposed:to invest in savings-banks until the soldier's\nreturn, or, if he fell, it would be paid to his relatives. This\nscheme would be,raade public in a few days by proclamation,\nand he trusted it--would be found to answer better than the in-\ncrease of bountywhich had been proposed.\nThe Leek Improvement Bill and the ,Livesey's Estate Bill\nwere read a third time and passed.\u2014The Assizes and'Sessions\nBill. passed through committee.\u2014The Woolmer .Forest Bill\nwas read a second time.\u2014The Spirits (Ireland) Act Amend-\nment Bill passed through committee.\u2014The amendments t)\nthe Friendly Socicties Bill were reported-and agreed to.\u2014The\nMilitia (No. 2) Bill was read a third time and passed, with\namendments.\u2014The Accidents on Railways Bill and the Na-\ntional Gallery, &c. {Dublin), Bill went through committee.\u2014\nTheir lordships adjourned at 8 o'clock.\n",

  "CAVALRY ENGAGEMENT NEAR EUPATORIA\n\nPARIS, Friday.\nThe following despatch, from General Pelissier, was posted\nat the Bourse to-day, dated October 1, and addressed to the\nMinister of War : _ _\n\nA brilliant cavalry engagement took place on the 29th of\nSeptember, at Koughill, five leagues north-east of Eupatoria,\nin which the Russian cavalry, commanded by General Korf,\nwas defeated by that of General d'Allonville.\nSix guns, 12 caissons, and field forges, with their carriages,\nfell into our hands, with 160 prisoners and 260 horses of the\nUhlans.\n\n___.\nThe_ enemy left 50 dead upon the field of battle, among\nwhom is Colonel Andreawski. Our loss is small, consisting\nof 6 killed and 27 wounded.\n\nRUSSIAN VERSION OF THE CAPTURE OF\nSEBASTOPOL.\n\nTHE first Russian version of the fall of Sebastopol is con-\ntained in the following general order addressed by Prince\nGortschakoff to his troops, and in an incomplete report of the\nprogress of the siege published in the Invalide Russe :\n\nGENERAL ORDER ADDRESSED TO THE ARMY OP THE SOUTH\nAND TO THE LAND AND SEA TROOPS IN THE CRIMEA.\n\nHead-quarters, Heights of Inkermann, in the vicinity\nof Sebastopol, Aug. 30 (Sept. 12).\nValiant Comrades,\u2014On the 12th of September last year, a\nstrong enemy's army appeared before the walls of Sebastopol.\nDespite its numerical superiority, despite the absence of ob-\nstacles which military science might have opposed to it in the\ntown, that army did not dare to attack it openly (literally,\nwith an open force), and undertook a regular siege.\nSince then, despite the formidable means at the disposal of\n",
  "STATE OF THE WOUNDED.\n\nIn reference to this subject the correspondent of the\nDaily .News reports as follows :\nI am sorry to learn that a large proportion of the wounds\nreceived by our men in the affair of the 18th are terminating\nfatally. The awfully severe nature of grape-shot wounds, to\nbe sure, gave reason to expect this ; though hardly, perhaps,\nto the extent in which the daily returns show it to be occur-\nring. Round shot and shell wounds, from their extent, are in\nmost cases fatal when received ; whilst those inflicted by grape\nor canister\u2014though sadly extensive too\u2014more frequently leave\nlife in the sufferer, at least for a time. Still, a limb struck by\neither of these last can seldom be saved from amputation, and\nafter the vast haemorrhage which must in the mean time have\ntaken place, few systems can survive the operation. So has it\nproved in the cases of very many of those carried off the\nfield on the 18th\u2014after lingering on doubtfully for days they\ngradually sinking and dropping off one by one. Apropos\nof this subject of the wounded, however, in remarkable\ncontrast to those who are daily succumbing, I may\nmention particularly one case which is considered of singu-\nlarly great surgical interest\u2014that of a young man named\nPalmer, a private in the 7th Fusiliers, who was shot through\nthe left parietal bone by a Minie bullet on the morn-\ning of the attempted storming. When carried into the field\nhospital, an hour or so after receiving the wound, the brain\nwas actually protruding through an orifice in the skull large\nenough to admit of the entrance of the doctor's finger into the\ninterior of the head in search of the ball. The surgeon\nassured me that he had to thrust his index finger to its full\nlength within the brain, to discover the bullet and the portion\nof the skull which it had carried inwards with it. Neither,\nhowever, could be found, nor has yet been extracted. In the\nmeantime the fractured bone is closing, and the patient con-\ntinues \"alive and alike like,\" eating his prescribed food regu-\nlarly, and displaying his wonted intelligence. By a large\nnumber of doctors who have seen it the case is considered one\nof the most remarkable in the history of modern surgery, and\nit certainly strikes an unprofessional looker-on as subversive\nof every preconceived notion of the brain\u2014vulnerability. A\nfew somewhat similar cases are, I believe, on record ; but in\nevery one of them the sufferer died on or about the ninth day,\nwhilst the individual to whom I now refer has at present every\nappearance of surviving, without at the same time sustaining\nany lasting cerebral injury.\n",
